  description: |
    SBA API is structured around REST. Having predictable resource-oriented URLs, our APIs accept form-encoded request bodies, return JSON responses, and use standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
    
    ### Supported document formats
    YAP currently supports PNG, JPEG, and PDF, TIFF, XLSX  formats.

    ### File size
    Image files sent to the YAP API should not exceed 100 MB (4 MB for the free tier). Reducing your file size can significantly improve throughput; however, be careful not to reduce image quality in the process.
    
    ### Image and PDF requirements
    - For PDF and TIFF files, up to 2000 pages (only first two pages for the free tier) are processed.
    - Dimensions at least 50 x 50 pixels and at most 10000 x 10000 pixels.
    - The PDF dimensions must be at most 17 x 17 inches, corresponding to legal or A3 paper sizes and smaller.
